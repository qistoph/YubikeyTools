This repository will contain some of my Yubikey related (code) projects.

To create a copy you could use:
git clone git://github.com/qistoph/YubikeyTools.git


For now there's just a single tool in the repository, YubikeyDecrypt.

YubikeyDecrypt
Visual interface to analyse data in Yubikey generated OTPs.
You will need the AES-key to decrypt the OTP.
Generating an OTP from input variables is still a bit buggy.
